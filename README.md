# Deep Neural Network Challange (Weizmann Institute)
## Project: Seq2Seq Predictor

### Description
In this project we tried to predict the glucose values, using Seq2Seq Model.(achieved around 0.62 pearson correlation).

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [fast-ai](https://www.fast.ai/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook DNN_challenge_X_y_example.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook DNN_challenge_X_y_example.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset for this project is origniated from weizmann institute glucose research, therefor not available on this git.


**Target**
- `regression`: Predict the next set of glucose values, using those that we have.
